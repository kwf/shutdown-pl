title: "Shutdown PL @ ICFP 2020"
---

In the United States, the most recent murders of Black people at the hands of police have prompted international protest that has itself been met with further police brutality---the latest manifestation of a centuries-old history of violence and oppression. We, as members of the global programming languages community, acknowledge that every institution in our society is built on a foundation of white supremacy---and our academic systems and research industry are no exception. We have the strongest moral imperative to act not just in this particular moment of political turmoil and uncertainty, but in lasting, sustainable ways to permanently transform our institutions against the systemic racism from which they benefit and which they perpetuate.

# Join Us at ICFP 2020

Shutdown PL began as a day of action for programming languages researchers, as part of the movement to [#ShutdownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/) for a global [#Strike4BlackLives](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Strike4BlackLives). For sustainable change, we have to incorporate anti-racist action as part of all our research activities. Our next action will be held as part of the virtual [International Conference on Functional Programming 2020](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/), responding to the conference's [Statement on Current Events](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/attending/icfp-statement-on-current-events).

# Sponsor Us at ICFP 2020

An important issue in access to opportunities in technology is paying people for their labor, since otherwise opportunities only go to those who can afford to work for free. We are looking for sponsors to support an important social change within CS research communities. As a sponsor, your name and logo will be included on the event web page and on the event video stream, you will be thanked during the event.

# Register

Please register at the main ICFP registration page once registration opens for the main conference.

Looking forward to seeing you there,
