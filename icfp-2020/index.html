      <h1>#ShutdownPL @ ICFP 2020</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">
        Thursday, August 27, 2020 from 2&ndash;6 PM (ET)
      </div>

      <p>
        Anti-Black racism is sustained by systems of discrimination that are
        pervasive accross our society, and academic spaces are no exception.
        Inspired by the recent
        <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" target="_blank">
          #ShutDownSTEM</a>
        movement and in response to the continued violence against Black people
        in the United States,
        the purpose of #ShutdownPL @ ICFP 2020 is to offer a safe space at
        <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/" target="_blank">
          ICFP 2020</a>
        in which to collaborate and take action against racism and systems of
        oppression in the programming languages community and beyond.
        We aim to continue the discussion at ICFP started by their
        <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/attending/icfp-statement-on-current-events"
           target="_blank">
          statement on current events</a>
        and, moreover, to enact positive change via concrete planning and
        action.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Important note</b>: As of now, none of the organizers of #ShutdownPL
        are Black. We do not want to demand labor of Black voices; however, the
        last thing we want is an organization of non-Black researchers speaking
        for and taking actions on the behalf of Black researchers without their
        input. Accordingly, we will ensure all our commitments to act begin from
        a place of listening to the Black community within and beyond
        programming languages research.
      </p>

      <p>
        We announce news via our Twitter account,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/ShutdownPL" target="_blank">

      <h2>Sponsor Us at ICFP 2020</h2>

      <div>
        <p>
          An important issue in access to opportunities in technology is paying
          individuals for their labor; otherwise, opportunities only go to those who
          can afford to work for free.
          We are looking for sponsors who support diversity and inclusion within
          CS research communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a sponsor, your name and logo will be included on the event
          webpage. Moreover, you will be thanked during the event, which will
          be video streamed.
