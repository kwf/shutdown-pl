# This Wednesday, June 10, it's time to #ShutdownPL

In the United States, recent acts of violence against Black people at the hands of police have prompted international protest that has itself been met with further abuse---the latest manifestation of a centuries-old history of violence and oppression. We, as members of the global programming languages community, acknowledge that every institution in our society is built on a foundation of white supremacy---and our academic systems and research industry are no exception. We have the strongest moral imperative to act not just in this particular moment of political turmoil and uncertainty, but in lasting, sustainable ways to permanently transform our institutions against the systemic racism from which they benefit and which they perpetuate.

The purpose of #ShutdownPL is to identify, discuss, and organize around opportunities for positive, anti-racist change in research spaces, academia, industry, and, in particular, the programming languages community.

## Organization

We want to note: as the organizers of #ShutdownPL, we do not want to demand labor of Black voices on a day that is focused on sustainable allyship. However, the last thing we want is a day of non-Black researchers speaking for and taking actions on the behalf of Black researchers without their input. Accordingly, we will ensure all our commitments to act begin from a place of listening to the Black community within and beyond programming languages research.
