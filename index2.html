        <br>

        <p>
            The purpose of #ShutdownPL @ ICFP 2020 is to create a space at ICFP 2020 to identify, discuss, and organize around opportunities for positive, anti-racist change in research spaces, academia, industry, and, in particular, the programming languages community.
            We acknowledge that anti-Black racism is sustained by systems of discrimination that are pervasive across our society, with academic spaces being no exception. Inspired by the recent #ShutdownSTEM event and in response to the continued violence against Black people
            in the US, #ShutdownPL @ ICFP aims to offer a safe space in which to collaborate and to take action against racism and systems of oppression.

                    Shutdown PL began as a day of action for programming languages researchers, as part of the movement to #ShutdownSTEM for a global #Strike4BlackLives. For sustainable change, we have to incorporate anti-racist action as part of all our research activities.
                    Our next action will be held as part of the virtual International Conference on Functional Programming 2020, responding to the conference’s Statement on Current Events.

                        An important issue in access to opportunities in technology is paying people for their labor, as otherwise opportunities only go to those who can afford to work for free. We are looking for sponsors who support diversity and inclusion within CS research communities. 
                        As a sponsor, your name and logo will be included on the event webpage. Moreover, you will be thanked during the event, which will be video streamed.
