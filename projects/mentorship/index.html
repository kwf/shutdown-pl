      <h1>Mentorship</h1>

      <p>
        The programming languages community is disproportionately and
        overwhelmingly non-Black. How can we increase the
        <b>accessibility</b>
        for and
        <b>retention</b>
        of Black students in the field?
      </p>

      <p>
        As academics, we often have a greater ability to effect change at the
        university level than elsewhere. As such, we will focus our discussion
        of <b>accessibility</b> on undergraduate students (particularly those
        attending HBCUs and universities without PL faculty), and we will focus
        our discussion of <b>retention</b> on graduate students already in the
        field.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will plan structural changes that need to occur as well as
        individual action that we can take as allies and mentors to Black
        students that will allow them to thrive in our community.

            This article specifically addresses how white people can be
            effective mentors to Black people and is worth reading in its
            entirety.

                Navigating racism: Black graduate students need support</a></b>.

              Research shows that the concept of
              &ldquo;othermothering&rdquo; and an
              &ldquo;ethics of care,&rdquo; which, broadly speaking, include
              mentorship beyond strictly academic matters, can be an immensely
              positive resource for marginalized students.

              Can we leverage insights from the first article into an ethics of
              care so that the emotional labor of othermothering does not always
              fall on Black (most often women) professors?

              For optional additional reading about othermothering and
              ethics of care, you can read or skim
