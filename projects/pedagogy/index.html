          What is one thing you can change about the way you teach PL to make
          it more accessible?
        </b>
      </p>

      <p>
        The field of programming languages, in both its theoretical and applied
        disciplines across academia and industry, is missing Black people.
        Plain and simple. There is strong evidence that computer science
        instructors subscribe to a bimodal model of student aptitude,
        disproportionately assuming Black students incapable of learning their
        material. This attitude amongst instructors, combined with the
        assumption that there is inherently a high theoretical threshold to
        work in programming languages, undoubtedly contributes to the
        unacceptable absence of Black students and scholars of PL.
      </p>

      <p>
        While there have been efforts to change the way &ldquo;CS 101&rdquo;
        is taught to an extent, no such efforts have been made to change the
        pedagogy of &ldquo;PL 101.&rdquo; This track is intended for anyone
        who teaches programming language theory, functional programming, or
        another relevant subject in any capacity. Through challenging your
        assumptions about your own instruction, you will hopefully arrive at
        a concrete way you might be able to improve it. (See readings for
        ideas!)

            This document covers introductory programming paradigm teaching
            methods. Skim any of the sections that appeal to you, but please
            make sure to read &sect;4 (intro), &sect;5.2, &sect;6.3, &sect;7.4,
            and &sect;8.

                Evidence That Computer Science Grades Are Not Bimodal</a></b>.

            This article deconstructs the perception of bimodal performance
            among CS students, i.e. that there are some students with innate
            ability and some without.

            The study is fairly short, and it&lsquo;s worth reading all of it
            for familiarity with the methodology. If short on time, please read
            &sect;1, &sect;4, &sect;5, and &sect;6.

            This is an exercise taken from the Fall 2019 introductory
            programming languages course at Brown.

            Read through the assignment statement and consider what you think
            is useful (or not) about its structure. What does it do to address
            the issues enumerated in the first reading?
