      <h1>Sustained Advocacy</h1>

      <p>
        A core goal of #ShutdownPL @ ICFP is to be more than a day of
        abstract &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; discussion. Instead, we want this to be
        an ongoing conversation, and to encourage action to take
        place as a result. Moreover, as more and more organizations
        and people are coming forward to commit to action and
        measurable change, none of us want to fall back into old
        habits of <i>complacency</i> and <i>superficial</i> adjustment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The advocacy discussion track will discuss and then propose realistic
        but effective projects to keep our institutions, our communities, and
        ourselves accountable to our commitments. Before the event, we
        encourage our attendees to reflect on the following question:
        <b>
            what are long-term commitments of social justice that you or your
            community have made or are considering making?
        </b>
        These will seed our conversation towards action.

            This website covers, at a high level, ideas for action that you can
            incorporate in your institutions to make an impact towards social
            justice. Read the different suggestions listed in there even if
            their label doesn&rsquo;t necessarily apply to you, as they could
            reveal interesting opportunities for you to suggest to peers in
            your institution/group/company.

            ours.
